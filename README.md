# Quiet

Quiet is a Go Message Queue client transparently bundling the functionality of multiple other clients

## Usage

```go
// A client connection is generated by calling the NewClientFromString() function.
// This takes in a full connection string.
client, err := quiet.NewClientFromString("amqpq://guest:guest@localhost5672/demo")

if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to create client instance: %s", err.Error())
}

// Messages are received by registering a code block with the Watch() function.
// Parse in a function that accepts the message as a paremter.
// This wil continue to run until the connection is closed
client.Watch(func(s string) {
    log.Printf("Message received: %s", s)
})

log.Print("Watching...")

for i := 0; i < 12; i++ {
    // Calling Post() will submit new messages to the queue
    client.Post(fmt.Sprintf("Hellow World #%d", i))
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}

// Close off the connection by calling the Close() function
client.Close()
```
